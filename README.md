# üñ•Ô∏è Operating System Labs

This repository contains all the Operating System labs I completed during the semester. The labs focus on key OS concepts such as process management, memory management, scheduling, synchronization, and shell implementation using C.

## üìÅ Lab List & Descriptions

### ‚úÖ Lab 1: Basic Linux Commands
- Practiced essential terminal commands for file handling, permissions, and navigation.
- Introduced to process control using `ps`, `kill`, `top`, etc.

### ‚úÖ Lab 2: Process Creation using `fork()`
- Wrote C programs using `fork()` to understand parent-child relationships.
- Observed how processes share and duplicate memory.

### ‚úÖ Lab 3: File I/O and Redirection
- Explored low-level file operations in C using `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.
- Implemented simple redirection of input/output streams.

### ‚úÖ Lab 4: Interprocess Communication (IPC)
- Implemented communication between processes using:
  - Pipes (`pipe()`)
  - Named pipes (FIFOs)
  - Message Queues

### ‚úÖ Lab 5: Threading with Pthreads
- Used `pthread_create`, `pthread_join`, and mutexes.
- Implemented basic multithreaded programs and synchronization.

### ‚úÖ Lab 6: CPU Scheduling Simulation
- Simulated FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin scheduling algorithms.
- Calculated waiting time and turnaround time for processes.

### ‚úÖ Lab 7: Memory Management
- Implemented paging and segmentation logic using arrays.
- Practiced page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU).

### ‚úÖ Lab 8: Mini Shell Implementation
- Created a basic shell in C that supports:
  - Command execution
  - History tracking (e.g., `!1` for repeating commands)
  - Input/output redirection
  - Limited piping
